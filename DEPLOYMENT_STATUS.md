## 🗄️ **Database Migrations Still Needed!**

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** The code is deployed, but you still need to run the database migrations in Supabase!

### **Run These Migrations:**

#### **1. Fix Availability Table**
Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zxbfygofxxmfivddwdqt/sql/new

Copy and run:
```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/20251101000000_fix_availability_time_type.sql
-- (Full content in the file)
```

#### **2. Fix Notifications & Booking Flow**
Still in SQL Editor, copy and run:
```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/20251101000001_fix_notifications_booking_flow.sql
-- (Full content in the file)
```

### **Quick SQL Migration:**

Or run this quick fix in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- 1. Fix notifications table
DO $$ 
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns 
    WHERE table_name = 'notifications' AND column_name = 'related_id'
  ) THEN
    ALTER TABLE notifications ADD COLUMN related_id UUID;
  END IF;
END $$;

-- 2. Create booking status function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_booking_status(
  p_booking_id UUID,
  p_new_status TEXT,
  p_cancellation_reason TEXT DEFAULT NULL
)
RETURNS BOOLEAN
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
DECLARE
  v_booking RECORD;
BEGIN
  SELECT * INTO v_booking FROM bookings WHERE id = p_booking_id;
  IF NOT FOUND THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Booking not found';
  END IF;
  
  UPDATE bookings
  SET 
    status = p_new_status,
    cancellation_reason = p_cancellation_reason,
    updated_at = NOW()
  WHERE id = p_booking_id;
  
  IF p_new_status = 'confirmed' THEN
    INSERT INTO notifications (
      user_id, type, title, message, related_id
    ) VALUES (
      v_booking.owner_id,
      'booking_confirmed',
      'Booking Confirmed!',
      'Your booking has been confirmed',
      p_booking_id
    );
  END IF;
  
  IF p_new_status = 'cancelled' THEN
    INSERT INTO notifications (
      user_id, type, title, message, related_id
    ) VALUES (
      CASE 
        WHEN v_booking.status = 'requested' THEN v_booking.owner_id
        ELSE v_booking.sitter_id
      END,
      'booking_cancelled',
      'Booking Cancelled',
      'A booking has been cancelled',
      p_booking_id
    );
  END IF;
  
  RETURN TRUE;
END;
$$;
```

## 🧪 **Testing After Deployment:**

### **1. Check if Site is Live:**
Wait ~2-5 minutes, then go to:
https://petflik.com/bookings

### **2. Test as Owner:**
- ✅ Should see "💳 Pay Now" button on confirmed bookings
- ✅ Click it → should redirect to payment page
- ✅ Payment page should show fee breakdown

### **3. Test as Sitter:**
- ✅ Should see "Accept" / "Decline" on requested bookings
- ✅ Click Accept → booking becomes confirmed
- ✅ Owner should see "Pay Now" button

---

## 🎯 **What's Fixed:**

### **Before:**
```
❌ "column related_id does not exist" error
❌ Decline button didn't work
❌ No Pay Now button for owners
❌ No payment flow
❌ No platform commission
```

### **After (Now):**
```
✅ Notifications table fixed
✅ Decline button works with reason
✅ Pay Now button shows for owners
✅ Full Stripe payment flow
✅ 20% automatic platform fee (you earn on every booking!)
```

---

## 💰 **Your Earnings:**

From every booking payment:
- **80%** goes to sitter
- **20%** goes to you (platform)

Example:
- Booking: €50
- Sitter gets: €40
- **You get: €10** 💵

This happens **automatically** via Stripe Connect!

---

## 📊 **Complete Flow:**

```
1. Owner creates booking
   └─> Status: requested

2. Sitter sees: [Accept] [Decline]
   Sitter clicks Accept
   └─> Status: confirmed

3. Owner sees: [💳 Pay Now - €50.00]  ← NEW!
   Owner clicks Pay Now
   └─> Redirects to Stripe payment

4. Owner pays with card
   └─> Payment held in escrow
   └─> Status: confirmed, payment_status: held

5. Service completed
   Owner clicks: [Release Payment]
   └─> €40 to sitter (80%)
   └─> €10 to you (20%)  💰
```

### **Payment page not loading:**
1. Check Stripe Connect function exists
2. Verify Stripe keys in Supabase environment
3. Check sitter has completed Stripe Connect onboarding
