## 🧪 Testing (Fast-Forward Time)

To test without waiting 3 days:

```sql
-- 1. Get your booking ID
SELECT id, status, payment_status, eligible_for_release_at
FROM bookings
WHERE status = 'completed'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- 2. Fast-forward the release date
UPDATE bookings 
SET eligible_for_release_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
WHERE id = '[paste-booking-id-here]';

-- 3. Check if eligible for release
SELECT * FROM get_bookings_for_auto_release();

-- 4. Manually trigger release (or wait for cron)
SELECT release_payment_to_sitter('[booking-id]'::uuid, false);

-- 5. Verify released
SELECT id, payment_status, payment_released_at
FROM bookings
WHERE id = '[booking-id]';
```

→ Make sure sitter marked service as complete first
→ Check booking status is 'completed'
