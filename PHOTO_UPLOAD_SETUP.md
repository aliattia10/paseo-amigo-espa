# Photo Upload Setup Guide

## Issue Fixed
âœ… **Fixed**: Page refresh on photo upload  
âœ… **Fixed**: Async upload with proper error handling  
âœ… **Fixed**: Storage bucket validation  
âœ… **Fixed**: Better user feedback during upload  

## Setup Required

### 1. Run Storage Setup SQL

The photo upload feature requires a Supabase Storage bucket called `avatars`. Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor, run:
database/fix_profile_storage.sql
```

Or manually execute this SQL:

```sql
-- Create avatars storage bucket if it doesn't exist
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('avatars', 'avatars', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET public = true;

-- Create storage policies for avatars
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'avatars' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);
```

### 2. Verify Setup

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > Storage
2. You should see a bucket called `avatars`
3. The bucket should be marked as "Public"
4. Policies should show 4 policies (upload, view, update, delete)

## How It Works Now

### User Experience
1. User clicks "Change Photo" button
2. File selector appears
3. User selects an image
4. Loading spinner appears on the photo
5. **Page does NOT refresh** âœ…
6. Upload happens in background
7. Success toast appears
8. New photo is immediately visible
9. Change is persistent (saved to database)

### Technical Flow

```typescript
// 1. User selects file
handleFileChange(event) 
  â”œâ”€ event.preventDefault() // Prevents page refresh
  â”œâ”€ Get file from input
  â””â”€ Call handleImageUpload(file)

// 2. Upload to Supabase
handleImageUpload(file)
  â”œâ”€ Validate file type & size
  â”œâ”€ Check storage bucket exists
  â”œâ”€ Delete old image (if exists)
  â”œâ”€ Upload new image to Supabase Storage
  â”œâ”€ Get public URL
  â”œâ”€ Update users table with new URL
  â””â”€ Refresh user profile in context

// 3. UI Updates
  â”œâ”€ Show loading spinner during upload
  â”œâ”€ Display new photo immediately
  â””â”€ Show success/error toast
```

## File Validations

- **Accepted Types**: Images only (image/*)
- **Max Size**: 5MB
- **Supported Formats**: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, etc.

## Error Handling

The system now provides specific error messages:

| Error | Message |
|-------|---------|
| Not logged in | "You must be logged in to upload images" |
| Wrong file type | "Please select an image file" |
| File too large | "Image must be less than 5MB" |
| Bucket not configured | "Storage bucket not configured..." |
| Permission denied | "Permission denied. Storage policies need to be configured." |
| Network error | Shows actual error from Supabase |

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run storage SQL script in Supabase
- [ ] Verify avatars bucket exists
- [ ] Upload a profile picture
- [ ] Page should NOT refresh
- [ ] Loading spinner should appear
- [ ] New photo should appear immediately
- [ ] Refresh page - photo should persist
- [ ] Log out and log back in - photo should still be there
- [ ] Try uploading different image - should replace old one
- [ ] Try uploading non-image file - should show error
- [ ] Try uploading 10MB file - should show "too large" error

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Page Still Refreshes
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure Button has `type="button"` (not "submit")
- Verify no `<form>` wrapper around the upload button

### Issue: Upload Fails with 406 Error
- Run the storage SQL script
- Check Supabase Storage dashboard for `avatars` bucket
- Verify RLS policies are created
- Check browser console for detailed error

### Issue: Upload Succeeds but Image Doesn't Show
- Check users table has `profile_image` column
- Verify the URL is being saved to database
- Check browser network tab for CORS errors
- Ensure bucket is marked as "Public"

### Issue: Permission Denied
- Verify user is logged in
- Check RLS policies in Supabase Storage
- Ensure policy checks `auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]`
- Files must be uploaded to `userId/filename.ext` structure

## Code Changes Made

### ProfileEditPage.tsx
1. Added `e.preventDefault()` to prevent form submission
2. Added storage bucket validation before upload
3. Improved error messages with specific guidance
4. Added explicit `type="button"` to prevent form submission
5. Added `onClick` handlers to prevent event propagation
6. Clear file input after upload for better UX

### Key Safety Features
- No form wrapper (direct div structure)
- Explicit `event.preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()`
- Button type explicitly set to "button"
- Async/await with try-catch for all operations
- Loading states to prevent duplicate uploads
- Input value cleared after upload

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Run storage SQL in Supabase
2. âœ… Test upload functionality
3. âœ… Verify persistence after page refresh
4. ðŸ”„ Deploy to production
5. ðŸ”„ Test on mobile devices
6. ðŸ”„ Monitor error logs in production

## Support

If issues persist after following this guide:
1. Check Supabase Dashboard > Storage > avatars bucket
2. Check Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Policies
3. Review browser console for detailed errors
4. Check network tab for 406, 403, or 404 errors
