# Tinder Gallery & Profile Connection Update

## Overview
Updated the home page to display Tinder-style cards with multiple images and ensured all profile creation flows are properly connected to edit pages and Supabase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Home Page - Tinder-Style Multi-Image Gallery

**File:** `src/components/dashboard/NewHomePage.tsx`

#### Features Added:
- **Multiple Images Support**: Changed `imageUrl` to `imageUrls` array in Profile interface
- **Image Progress Bars**: Tinder-style progress indicators at the top of cards
- **Tap Navigation**: Tap left/right sides of card to navigate between images
- **Auto-Reset**: Image index resets when switching profiles or roles
- **Sample Data**: Updated mock profiles with multiple images (1-3 images each)

#### How It Works:
```typescript
// Progress bars show which image is active
{currentProfile.imageUrls.map((_, index) => (
  <div className={`progress-bar ${index === currentImageIndex ? 'active' : ''}`} />
))}

// Tap zones for navigation
<div onClick={() => previousImage()} /> // Left 1/3
<div onClick={() => nextImage()} />     // Right 1/3
```

#### User Experience:
- Swipe left/right to pass/like profiles (unchanged)
- Tap left side of card to see previous image
- Tap right side of card to see next image
- Progress bars at top show current image position
- Image index resets when moving to next profile

### 2. Profile Creation â†’ Edit Page Flow

#### Pet Owner Profile Setup
**File:** `src/pages/DogOwnerProfileSetup.tsx`

**Changes:**
- After creating pet profile, now redirects to `/pet/{id}/edit` instead of dashboard
- Fetches the newly created pet ID from database
- Shows success message: "Pet profile created! You can add more photos and details."
- Allows users to immediately add more photos using the Tinder-style gallery

**Flow:**
1. User creates pet profile with basic info + 1 photo
2. Profile saved to `pets` table (or `dogs` as fallback)
3. System fetches the created pet ID
4. Redirects to PetEditPage where user can:
   - Add up to 6 photos total
   - Edit all pet details
   - Use Tinder-style gallery navigation

#### Sitter Profile Setup
**File:** `src/pages/SitterProfileSetup.tsx`

**Changes:**
- After creating sitter profile, now redirects to `/profile/edit` instead of home
- Shows success message: "Sitter profile created! You can update your details anytime."
- Allows users to immediately update their profile details

**Flow:**
1. User creates sitter profile with bio, rate, experience
2. Profile saved to `users` table
3. Redirects to ProfileEditPage where user can:
   - Update profile picture
   - Edit personal information
   - Update bio and other details

### 3. Database Connection

All profile operations are properly connected to Supabase:

#### Pet Profiles:
- **Primary Table**: `pets` (with `image_url` as JSON array)
- **Fallback Table**: `dogs` (for backward compatibility)
- **Image Storage**: `avatars` bucket under `pets/` folder
- **Multi-Image Support**: Images stored as JSON array: `["url1", "url2", "url3"]`

#### User Profiles:
- **Table**: `users`
- **Fields**: `name`, `phone`, `city`, `postal_code`, `bio`, `profile_image`, `hourly_rate`
- **Image Storage**: `avatars` bucket under user ID folder

### 4. Edit Pages Already Support Multi-Image

#### PetEditPage
**File:** `src/pages/PetEditPage.tsx`

Already has full Tinder-style gallery:
- Upload up to 6 photos
- Navigate between photos with arrows
- Dot indicators showing current position
- Delete individual photos
- Immediate save to database on upload/delete

#### ProfileEditPage
**File:** `src/pages/ProfileEditPage.tsx`

Already properly connected:
- Upload profile picture
- Edit all user details
- Immediate save to database
- Proper error handling
