# Cross-Platform Location Permission Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing location permissions that work seamlessly across web browsers, Android (Google Play), and iOS (Apple App Store) platforms for the Petflik app.

## Glossary

- **Geolocation API**: Browser-based API for accessing device location
- **Capacitor**: Cross-platform native runtime for web apps
- **PWA**: Progressive Web App - web application that can be installed
- **Native Permissions**: Platform-specific permission systems (Android/iOS)
- **Fallback Mode**: Global browsing mode when location is unavailable

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Web Browser Location Permission

**User Story:** As a web user, I want to grant location permission through my browser so that I can see nearby matches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first opens the app, THE System SHALL display a location permission prompt
2. WHEN the user clicks "Enable Location", THE System SHALL request browser geolocation permission
3. IF the user grants permission, THEN THE System SHALL store the location and show nearby profiles
4. IF the user denies permission, THEN THE System SHALL offer global browsing mode
5. WHEN location permission is granted, THE System SHALL update user location in the database

### Requirement 2: Android (Google Play) Location Permission

**User Story:** As an Android user, I want to grant location permission through Android settings so that the app can find nearby matches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Android app requests location, THE System SHALL use Android's location permission system
2. WHEN the user denies permission, THE System SHALL show a dialog explaining why location is needed
3. IF the user previously denied permission, THEN THE System SHALL provide a button to open Android settings
4. WHEN location permission is granted, THE System SHALL use Google Play Services for accurate location
5. THE System SHALL handle both "While using app" and "Always" permission levels

### Requirement 3: iOS (Apple App Store) Location Permission

**User Story:** As an iOS user, I want to grant location permission through iOS settings so that the app can find nearby matches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the iOS app requests location, THE System SHALL use iOS Core Location framework
2. WHEN requesting permission, THE System SHALL display the purpose string from Info.plist
3. IF the user denies permission, THEN THE System SHALL show instructions to enable in Settings
4. WHEN location permission is granted, THE System SHALL use iOS location services
5. THE System SHALL handle both "When In Use" and "Always" authorization levels

### Requirement 4: Progressive Web App (PWA) Installation

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to install Petflik as a PWA so that it feels like a native app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits on mobile, THE System SHALL show an install prompt
2. WHEN installed as PWA, THE System SHALL request location permission like a native app
3. THE System SHALL include a manifest.json with proper configuration
4. THE System SHALL register a service worker for offline functionality
5. WHEN installed, THE System SHALL have an app icon on the home screen

### Requirement 5: Capacitor Native Bridge (Optional)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Capacitor to build native Android/iOS apps so that users get the best native experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Capacitor, THE System SHALL use native Geolocation plugin
2. THE System SHALL handle platform-specific permission requests
3. THE System SHALL provide fallback to web implementation
4. WHEN building for Android, THE System SHALL include required permissions in AndroidManifest.xml
5. WHEN building for iOS, THE System SHALL include usage descriptions in Info.plist

### Requirement 6: Permission State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to remember my location preference so that I don't have to grant permission every time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN permission is granted, THE System SHALL store the preference in localStorage
2. WHEN the app loads, THE System SHALL check previous permission state
3. IF permission was previously granted, THEN THE System SHALL automatically request location
4. IF permission was denied, THEN THE System SHALL default to global mode
5. THE System SHALL provide a settings option to change location preference

### Requirement 7: Graceful Degradation

**User Story:** As a user without location access, I want to still use the app in global mode so that I can browse all profiles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN location is unavailable, THE System SHALL automatically enable global mode
2. THE System SHALL display a clear indicator showing global mode is active
3. WHEN in global mode, THE System SHALL show all profiles without distance filtering
4. THE System SHALL allow users to manually toggle between local and global modes
5. IF location becomes available later, THEN THE System SHALL offer to switch to local mode

### Requirement 8: Location Accuracy and Updates

**User Story:** As a user, I want my location to be accurate and updated so that I see the most relevant nearby matches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting location, THE System SHALL request high accuracy positioning
2. THE System SHALL update location when the user moves significantly (>1km)
3. THE System SHALL cache location for 1 hour to reduce battery usage
4. WHEN location is stale, THE System SHALL request a fresh location
5. THE System SHALL handle location errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

### Requirement 9: Privacy and Security

**User Story:** As a user, I want my location data to be private and secure so that only matched users can see my approximate location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL only store latitude/longitude in the database when user enables location
2. THE System SHALL NOT share exact location with unmatched users
3. WHEN displaying distance, THE System SHALL show rounded values (e.g., "1.2 miles")
4. THE System SHALL allow users to disable location at any time
5. WHEN location is disabled, THE System SHALL remove location data from the database

### Requirement 10: User Education and Onboarding

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to understand why location permission is needed so that I feel comfortable granting it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting location, THE System SHALL explain the benefits clearly
2. THE System SHALL show examples of how location improves matching
3. THE System SHALL emphasize privacy and security measures
4. THE System SHALL provide a "Learn More" option with detailed information
5. THE System SHALL never force users to enable location to use the app
