# ✅ Pay Now Button Fix

## Problem Solved
The owner wasn't seeing a "Pay Now" button after the sitter accepted the booking.

## What Changed

### Updated BookingsPage.tsx

#### 1. **Added Payment Status & User IDs to Bookings Data**
Now we track:
- `payment_status` - whether payment has been made
- `owner_id` - to check if current user is the owner
- `sitter_id` - to check if current user is the sitter

#### 2. **Added "Pay Now" Button for Owners**
```tsx
💳 Pay Now - €XX.XX
```

Shows when:
- ✅ Booking status is `confirmed` (sitter accepted)
- ✅ Payment hasn't been made yet (`payment_status` is null or 'pending')
- ✅ Current user is the **owner** of the booking

#### 3. **Better Button Logic by Role**

**For SITTERS:**
- See `[Accept]` `[Decline]` buttons on **requested** bookings
- When they click Accept → booking becomes `confirmed`
- Owner gets notified to pay

**For OWNERS:**
- See `💳 Pay Now - €XX.XX` button on **confirmed** bookings
- When they click it → redirects to Stripe payment page
- Payment automatically splits: 80% sitter, 20% platform

#### 4. **Improved Status Messages**
- "✓ Payment secured - Waiting for service" - when payment is held
- Clear role-specific buttons
- No confusion about who needs to do what
