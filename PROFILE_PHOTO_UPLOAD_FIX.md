# Profile Photo Upload Fix

## Problem
When users clicked "Change Photo" on the Edit Profile page, the entire page would refresh instead of uploading the photo asynchronously. This prevented the photo from being uploaded to Supabase.

## Root Cause
1. **Form wrapper** - The page was wrapped in a `<form>` element that was triggering default form submission
2. **Button inside label** - The Button component inside a label was causing event bubbling issues
3. **Missing preventDefault** - Not all click events had explicit `preventDefault()` calls

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Form Wrapper
```tsx
// BEFORE: Wrapped in form
<form onSubmit={handleFormSubmit}>
  <main>...</main>
</form>

// AFTER: No form wrapper
<main>...</main>
```

### 2. Replaced Button with Styled Label
```tsx
// BEFORE: Button inside label (problematic)
<label htmlFor="profile-picture">
  <Button type="button">Change Photo</Button>
</label>

// AFTER: Styled label (clean)
<label 
  htmlFor="profile-picture"
  className="inline-flex items-center... cursor-pointer"
>
  Change Photo
</label>
```

### 3. Added Explicit preventDefault
```tsx
// All buttons now have explicit preventDefault
onClick={(e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  e.stopPropagation();
  handleSave();
}}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **User clicks "Change Photo"**
   - Label triggers hidden file input
   - No page refresh

2. **User selects image**
   - `handleFileChange` is called with `e.preventDefault()`
   - File validation (type, size)
   - `handleImageUpload` starts asynchronously

3. **Upload process**
   - Shows loading spinner on avatar
   - Uploads to Supabase Storage (`avatars` bucket)
   - Gets public URL
   - Updates database (`users.profile_image`)
   - Refreshes user profile in context
   - Shows success toast

4. **Result**
   - Photo appears immediately
   - No page refresh
   - Change is persistent

## Technical Details

### Upload Flow
```javascript
handleImageUpload(file) {
  1. Validate file (type, size)
  2. Upload to Supabase Storage
     - Bucket: 'avatars'
     - Path: `${userId}/${timestamp}.${ext}`
  3. Get public URL
  4. Update database
     - Table: 'users'
     - Column: 'profile_image'
  5. Refresh auth context
  6. Show success message
}
```

### Error Handling
- ✅ File type validation (images only)
- ✅ File size validation (max 5MB)
- ✅ Storage bucket errors
- ✅ Database update errors
- ✅ Network errors
- ✅ User-friendly error messages

### Storage Configuration
Make sure you've run `database/fix_storage_bucket.sql` to configure:
- `avatars` bucket (public)
- Upload policies for authenticated users
- 5MB file size limit
- Allowed types: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Click "Change Photo" - no page refresh
- [x] Select image - shows loading spinner
- [x] Upload completes - photo appears immediately
- [x] Refresh page - photo persists
- [x] Try large file (>5MB) - shows error
- [x] Try non-image file - shows error
- [x] Upload while offline - shows error
- [x] Multiple uploads - works correctly

## Before vs After

### Before ❌
- Click "Change Photo" → Page refreshes
- Photo never uploads
- User confused
- Data not saved

### After ✅
- Click "Change Photo" → File picker opens
- Select image → Loading spinner shows
- Upload completes → Photo appears instantly
- Refresh page → Photo persists
- Professional UX

## Additional Notes

The same pattern should be applied to:
- Pet photo uploads
- Sitter profile photo uploads
- Any other image upload features

All image uploads should:
1. Use hidden file input with label
2. Call `e.preventDefault()` immediately
3. Show loading state
4. Upload asynchronously
5. Update database
6. Refresh context
7. Show feedback to user
