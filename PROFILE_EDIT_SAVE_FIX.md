# Profile Edit Save Fix

## Problem
When editing profile at `/profile/edit` and clicking save, the page redirected to `/profile` but the changes weren't visible. The data was being saved to the database, but the profile page wasn't refreshing to show the updated information.

## Root Cause
1. The `ProfileEditPage` was saving data correctly and calling `refreshUserProfile()` to update the AuthContext
2. However, the `NewProfilePage` component was only loading `userProfile` from context on initial mount
3. When navigating back from edit, the component wasn't re-fetching the profile data
4. The 1-second delay before navigation was unnecessary and made the UX feel sluggish

## Solution
### 1. Added Profile Refresh on Mount (NewProfilePage.tsx)
- Added `refreshUserProfile` to the component's dependencies from `useAuth()`
- Added a `useEffect` hook that calls `refreshUserProfile()` whenever the component mounts or `currentUser` changes
- This ensures the profile data is always fresh when viewing the profile page

### 2. Removed Navigation Delay (ProfileEditPage.tsx)
- Removed the 1-second `setTimeout` before navigation
- Now navigates immediately after `refreshUserProfile()` completes
- This makes the save action feel more responsive

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/profile/NewProfilePage.tsx` - Added profile refresh on mount
2. `src/pages/ProfileEditPage.tsx` - Removed navigation delay

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Go to https://petflik.com/profile/edit
2. Change any field (name, phone, city, etc.)
3. Click "Save"
4. You should be redirected to `/profile` and see your changes immediately

## Technical Details
The fix leverages React's `useEffect` hook to automatically refresh profile data when:
- The component first mounts
- The user returns from the edit page
- The `currentUser` changes (e.g., after login)

This ensures the profile page always displays the most up-to-date information from the database.
