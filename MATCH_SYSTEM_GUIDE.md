# 🎉 Tinder-Style Match System

## Overview
The app now has a complete Tinder-style matching system with "Woof Woof!" celebrations!

## Features Implemented

### 1. 🐾 Match Detection
- When a dog owner likes a sitter (or vice versa)
- System checks if the other person also liked them
- If both liked each other → **IT'S A MATCH!**

### 2. 🎊 "Woof Woof!" Match Modal
- Beautiful animated modal appears when you match
- Shows both profile pictures with a heart in the middle
- "Woof Woof! 🐾" header with bounce animation
- Two action buttons:
  - **Send Message** - Opens chat with matched user
  - **Keep Swiping** - Continue browsing

### 3. 🔔 Match Notifications
- Both users receive a notification: "🎉 It's a Match!"
- Notification includes the matched person's name
- Appears in the notifications page
- Can be marked as read

### 4. 💾 Database Tables

#### `matches` table:
- Stores all successful matches
- Prevents duplicate matches
- Tracks when the match happened

#### `likes` table:
- Tracks who liked whom
- Used to detect mutual likes
- Prevents duplicate likes

### 5. 🔧 Smart Function
`check_and_create_match()` function:
- Records the like
- Checks for mutual like
- Creates match if both liked
- Sends notifications to both users
- Returns TRUE if it's a match

## How It Works

### User Flow:

1. **Browse Profiles**
   - Swipe through sitters/dogs
   - Click ❤️ to like someone

2. **Like Action**
   - System records your like
   - Checks if they liked you too
   - If NO match: Shows "❤️ Liked!" toast
   - If MATCH: Shows "Woof Woof!" modal

3. **Match Modal**
   - Animated celebration
   - Profile pictures displayed
   - Option to message immediately
   - Or continue swiping

4. **After Match**
   - Both users get notifications
   - Match appears in messages (future feature)
   - Can start chatting
   - Can send booking requests

## Database Setup

### Step 1: Run the Migration

4. Wait for success message

### Step 2: Verify Tables
```sql
SELECT * FROM matches;
SELECT * FROM likes;
```

## Testing the Match System

### Test Scenario:
1. Create two accounts (Owner & Sitter)
2. As Owner, like the Sitter

## Technical Details

### Match Logic:
```typescript
1. User A likes User B
2. System checks: Did User B like User A?
3. If YES:
   - Create match record
   - Send notifications
   - Show modal
4. If NO:
   - Just record the like
   - Wait for User B to like back
```

### Security:
- Row Level Security enabled
- Users can only see their own matches
- Can't match with themselves
- Unique constraints prevent duplicates
