## üìã Payment Flow Explained

### **Complete Booking Flow:**

1. **Owner Creates Booking**
   ```
   Status: requested
   Payment: none
   ```

2. **Sitter Clicks "Accept"**
   ```
   Status: confirmed
   Notification sent to Owner
   ```

3. **Owner Sees Notification / Visits Bookings**
   ```
   Owner clicks "Accept" button
   ‚Üí Redirects to /payment?bookingId=xxx&amount=yyy
   ```

4. **Payment Page**
   ```
   - Calls create-payment-with-connect
   - Creates Stripe Payment Intent with:
     * Total Amount: Full booking price
     * Platform Fee: 20% (auto-calculated)
     * Sitter Amount: 80% (goes to sitter's Stripe Connect)
   - Shows fee breakdown to owner
   ```

5. **Owner Pays**
   ```
   - Stripe processes payment
   - Funds held in escrow
   - Booking updated: payment_status = 'held'
   - Status: confirmed
   ```

6. **Service Completed**
   ```
   - Owner clicks "Release Payment"
   - Calls capture-payment function
   - 80% transferred to sitter's account
   - 20% kept by platform (you)
   - Status: completed
   ```

### **If Owner Cancels:**
```
- Owner clicks "Decline" / "Cancel & Refund"
- Funds returned to owner
- Status: cancelled
```

## üí∞ Commission Breakdown

For every booking:

| Amount | Goes To | Percentage |
|--------|---------|------------|
| ‚Ç¨100   | **‚Ç¨80** to Sitter | 80% |
| ‚Ç¨100   | **‚Ç¨20** to Platform (You) | 20% |

**Example:**
- Booking Price: ‚Ç¨50
- Sitter Receives: ‚Ç¨40
- Platform Receives: ‚Ç¨10
