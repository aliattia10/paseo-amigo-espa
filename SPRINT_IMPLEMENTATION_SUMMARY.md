psql -h db.zxbfygofxxmfivddwdqt.supabase.co -U postgres -d postgres

# Run the migration
\i database/sprint_enhanced_profiles_availability_booking.sql
```

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI if not already installed
npm install -g supabase

# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Link to your project
supabase link --project-ref zxbfygofxxmfivddwdqt

# Generate types
supabase gen types typescript --linked > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
```

### 3. Test the Flow

**For Dog Owners:**
1. Sign up as "Dog Owner"
2. Complete dog profile with picture, temperament, energy level
3. Browse sitters and view their availability
4. Create booking request
5. View bookings in Bookings tab

**For Sitters:**
1. Sign up as "Sitter"
2. Complete sitter profile with bio, rate, experience
3. Set availability in Availability page
4. Receive booking requests
5. Accept/decline bookings

## 📊 Data Flow

### Booking Creation Flow
1. Owner selects sitter and clicks "Book Now"
2. Owner fills booking form (dog, date, time, duration)
3. System calls `create_booking` RPC function
4. Function:
   - Calculates commission (20%)
   - Creates booking with 'requested' status
   - Creates notification for sitter
5. Owner redirected to Bookings page

### Booking Acceptance Flow
1. Sitter views booking request in Bookings tab
2. Sitter clicks "Accept"
3. System calls `update_booking_status` RPC function with 'confirmed'
4. Function:
   - Updates booking status to 'confirmed'
   - Marks overlapping availability slot as 'booked'
   - Creates notification for owner
5. Both parties see updated status

### Availability Management Flow
1. Sitter navigates to Availability page
2. Sitter selects date
3. Sitter adds time slots (custom or quick add)
4. System calls `add_availability_slot` RPC function
5. Slot saved with 'available' status
6. When booking confirmed, slot status changes to 'booked'
