### Common Issues:

**Q: Payment not releasing after 3 days?**

**Q: Can't confirm completion?**
A: Sitter must mark service complete first

**Q: Review not saving?**
A: Booking must be completed status

**Q: Want to test without waiting 3 days?**
A: Update `eligible_for_release_at` in database (see testing guide)
