# Media & Location Features Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up the new media messaging and location-based matching features in Petflik.

## üéØ Features Added

### 1. Media Support in Messages
- Users can send **images** and **videos** in chat messages
- Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP (images), MP4, WebM (videos)
- Maximum file size: 10MB
- Media is stored in Supabase Storage
- Automatic thumbnail generation for videos

### 2. Location-Based Matching
- Users can enable location to see nearby matches
- Distance calculation in kilometers/miles
- Privacy-focused: location only shared with matched users
- Global mode toggle to see all users regardless of location

## üìã Database Setup

### Step 1: Run the Migration

Execute the SQL migration to add media and location support:

```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
database/add_media_and_location.sql
```

This migration will:
- Add `media_url`, `media_type`, and `media_thumbnail_url` columns to messages table
- Add `latitude`, `longitude`, `location_enabled` columns to users table
- Create distance calculation functions
- Set up storage bucket for message media
- Configure RLS policies for privacy

### Step 2: Verify Storage Bucket

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage
2. Verify that `message-media` bucket exists
3. Check that it's set to **public** (for easy media access)
4. Verify storage policies are in place

## üîß How It Works

### Media Messaging

1. **Sending Media:**
   - User clicks the image icon in chat
   - Selects an image or video file
   - Preview appears before sending
   - File is uploaded to Supabase Storage
   - Message is sent with media URL

2. **Viewing Media:**
   - Images display inline in chat bubbles
   - Videos have playback controls
   - Click images to open in new tab
   - Media loads from CDN for fast delivery

### Location-Based Matching

1. **Location Permission:**
   - On first visit, users see a location prompt
   - Three options:
     - **Enable Location**: Uses GPS for nearby matches

     - **Maybe Later**: Skip for now

2. **Local Mode (Default):**
   - Shows profiles within 50km radius
   - Sorted by distance (closest first)

3. **Global Mode:**
   - Toggle with globe icon (top right)
   - Shows all profiles regardless of location
