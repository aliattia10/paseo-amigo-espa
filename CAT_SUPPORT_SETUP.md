# 🐱 Cat Support Setup Guide

## Overview
Your app now has comprehensive cat support! This includes:
- Pet type selection (Dog 🐶 or Cat 🐱) during profile creation
- Cat-specific match sounds ("Meow Meow!" instead of "Woof Woof!")
- Updated booking system for both cats and dogs
- Enhanced sitter experience tags including cat care
- Pet type icons throughout the app

## Database Migration Required

To enable cat support, you need to run the database migration in Supabase:

### Steps:

   - Select your project

2. **Run the Migration**
   - Navigate to SQL Editor
   - Copy the contents of `database/add_cat_support.sql`
   - Paste and run the SQL

3. **What the Migration Does:**
   - Creates a new `pets` table (replacing `dogs`)
   - Adds `pet_type` column ('dog' or 'cat')
   - Migrates existing dog data to pets table
   - Updates bookings table to reference pets
   - Expands service types: walk, sitting, boarding, daycare, visit
   - Sets up proper RLS policies
